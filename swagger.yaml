    This documentation provides information about the interface for developers
    who would like to gain access to Shoptet

    e-shops. For more information about Shoptet, see https://www.shoptet.cz/.


    The API is available in two access modes:


    - for "Shoptet partner” developers who create the interconnection with the
    services and extend the Shoptet system's
      functions for public usage.  For more information about API and conditions, under which
      it can be used, see https://developers.shoptet.com/addons/.

    - direct private access to eshop data for eshop owner - available only for
    [Premium Members](https://www.shoptetpremium.cz/).
      See https://developers.shoptet.com/premium for more information about API access.

    # Basic principles of working with API


    ## How to call API


    API supports communication in JSON format. The URL for calling API requests
    is https://api.myshoptet.com. The API calls

    (endpoints and message formats) are common for private as well as addons
    access, it however uses different authentication

    and authorization principles.


    ### For Addons


    API is made to create the supplements for the Shoptet system and uses OAuth2
    authorization principles.

    To access the API it is necessary to implement a web service at your side,
    which will communicate with our OAuth server.


    In your e-shop administration, which you are using to work with our API, you
    must search in the `API Partner` section for the `Access to API` tab.

    Here, you will find your clientID and addresses, from where you can call our
    OAuth server.


    The work with API begins with e-shop addon installation. (The installation
    process can be tested in the addon detail in the `Users` section, where you
    can cause the installation for your e-shop.)

    In your addon detail, in the `Settings` section, enter URL to gain a OAuth
    code. The URL must be linked to your server, where the script is prepared,
    which is able to gain an OAuth access token.

    At this address, you will receive the HTTP request with a GET parameter
    `code`, when installing the addon, with unique value (a 255 character long
    string).

    The `code` provided only has short-term validity and can be used only once.
    With this code, request our OAuth server to provide an `OAuth access token`.

    Such a request shall follow within the same script that received the `code`.

    Do not put off gaining the OAuth access token for a later time, and do not
    reply to our request with a `200 OK` status, until you gain the OAuth access
    token.

    The address for you to call, and an example of implementation, can be found
    in e-shop administration in the `Access to API` section.


    As a response you will obtain a JSON with your OAuth access token. Save this
    token securely. Never send this token to the client computer, and use it
    only

    for communication between the servers and for gaining the temporary token
    for access to API.


    If you have successfully received an OAuth access token, your script must
    end with the HTTP status code “200”.


    Now you have your OAuth access token, which links your addon with a specific
    e-shop, perhaps you would like to communicate with the e-shop via API.


    From your server, call
    `https://<eshop-address.tld>/action/ApiOAuthServer/getAccessToken` address
    with HTTP header `Authorization: Bearer <OAuth access token>`.

    As the reply, you will receive a JSON containing an API access token value
    and the token expiration time value. An example of calling can be found in
    e-shop administration in the `Access to API` section.

    It is possible to request a maximum of 5 valid tokens.


    The API access token will enable you to call an individual URL of our API,
    for example `https://api.myshoptet.com/api/eshop`. Send the API access token
    in each request in the HTTP header`Shoptet-Access-Token`.


    You can have several valid API access tokens available at any one time.
    Should the validity of the API access token expire, you will receive a HTTP
    status code 401 and message about token expiration.


    ```

    {
        "data": null,
        "errors": [
            {
                "errorCode": "expired-token",
                "message": "Token is expired. Please ask for new one.",
                "instance": "unknown"
            }
        ]
    }

    ```


    If your token does not have the access right for a specific endpoint, you
    will obtain a reply with HTTP status code 403 Forbidden.


    ```

    {
        "data": null,
        "errors": [
            {
                "errorCode": "invalid-token-no-rights",
                "message": "Your access token \"afd..123\" has no defined rights for this resource.",
                "instance": "access-token"
            }
        ]
    }

    ```


    ### For private API access (Premium)


    You can create API access tokens simply in the eshop administration. Send
    them in the request header `Shoptet-Private-API-Token`.

    You can automatically access all API endpoints.


    ## Rate limiting


    Rate limiting is only at the level of server overload protection (DDoS),
    whereas the quantity of queries or total volume of data are unlimited.

    These are therefore the limits of the maximum number of coincident active
    connections. A maximum of 50 from a single IP address, and a maximum of

    3 connections for a single token. If the limit is exceeded, the HTTP code
    429 is returned. See also Nginx configuration:


    ```
        limit_conn per_ip 50;
        limit_conn per_token 3;
        limit_conn_status 429;
    ```


    Some URLs, for example for bulk operations, can have their own specific
    limits, which are mentioned in this documentation.


    <a name="locks"></a>


    ## Locks


    Write endpoints (DELETE, PATCH, POST, PUT methods) can take longer and may
    be prone to two concurrent matching requests.

    To avoid problems with retrying identical write requests, we have added the
    locking function of these requests to the application.

    If you execute the same request two times in quick succession, the second
    request receives error response with a 423 code.

    The lock is only valid for a specific called URL, for the duration of the
    request processing, but no longer than 5 seconds.


    <a name="versioning"></a>


    ## API versioning


    Current version of API: v1.0


    The client must send a `Content-Type` header with value of
    `application/vnd.shoptet.v1.0`,

    where `v1.0` is the API version supported by the client. If there is any
    change in the API, then we are trying to make it

    reverse compatible, therefore it is not necessary to regularly update your
    connection after each change in our interface.


    The version is the same for all endpoints described here.


    ## Server response format


    All JSON responses from the server have the same format, as a base.

    If any of the sections is not present in the response, a `null` value is
    then received.


    Example of call for addons:


    ```

    curl --include \
        -H 'Shoptet-Access-Token: 123456-a-111-cd03d85722b135929cde27e8799de3d0' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.shoptet.v1.0' \
       'https://api.myshoptet.com/api/eshop'
    ```


    Example of call for private API access:


    ```

    curl --include \
        -H 'Shoptet-Private-API-Token: 123456-p-100-cd03d85722b135929c7de27e8799de30' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/vnd.shoptet.v1.0' \
       'https://api.myshoptet.com/api/eshop'
    ```


    Example of response:


    ```

    HTTP/2 200

    date: Fri, 13 Jul 2018 15:57:29 GMT

    content-type: application/vnd.shoptet.v1.0+json; charset=utf-8


    {
        "data": {
            "contactInformation": {
                "eshopName": "www.domena-eshopu.cz",
                "url": "https:\/\/www.domena-eshopu.cz\/",
                "companyId": "28935675",
               ...
            }
            ...
        },
        "errors": null
    }

    ```


    The basic structure of the response in the event of an error is as follows:


    ```

    {
        "data": null,
        "errors": [
            {
                "errorCode": "missing-access-token",
                "message": "Missing access token. Please add `Shoptet-Access-Token` header to your request.",
                "instance": "unknown"
            }
        ]
    }

    ```


    Most of the endpoints are synchronous, i.e. your answer is provided
    immediately and contains the data requested. There

    are however some endpoints, where either the request or the response
    processing takes longer time. These are implemented as

    [Asynchronous
    requests](https://developers.shoptet.com/asynchronous-requests/). Your
    request will be queued and you

    receive only job identification in the response. You will be notified using
    a

    [webhook](https://developers.shoptet.com/api/documentation/webhooks/) when
    the job is completed and your results

    downloadable. Be aware, that registration of webhook `job:finished` is
    required to be able to run asynchronous requests.

    If webhook is not registered, you will receive an error response with HTTP
    status code 403 and job won`t be queued.


    Some attributes may be added to the new API version, or the sequence of
    attributes can be changed.

    Your software, therefore, shall not rely on either of these.

    If some attributes are renamed or removed, you will be informed in an
    additional

    header - see also [API versioning](#versioning) and [Deprecated header +
    Sunset](#deprecated).


    <a name="deprecated"></a>


    ## Deprecated header + Sunset


    If you are calling some endpoint in a version that will not be supported in
    the future, you will receive a response with the header

    `X-Shoptet-Deprecated`. If you detect this header within the response and
    its presence is logged,

    you should be aware of the support termination for a specific endpoint in
    advance and thus have enough time for correction.


    Furthermore, you shall also receive the response with a`Sunset` header with
    the date when the support for this endpoint is to be terminated.

    For more information about the header, see
    [Sunset](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-wilde-sunset-header-03.html).


    ## Status codes


    When processing the response, the client shall first detect, what response
    status code was received.


    For GET requests for responses with 200 code, it is not necessary to explore
    the `errors` part of the response.

    For PATCH/PUT requests, which can process more records at the same time and
    some records

    are not processed successfully, these end with a 200 response code and the
    errors key contains info
     on skipped rows.

    The unknown record is returned with a 404 code, etc. These responses have
    the error field filled in, where you can

    find detailed info about the error.


    The following errors might be expected:


    * 400 - Some of the validations on item level have failed. There is no
    reason to retry, it will fail always.


    * 401 - Invalid token or the token has expired (for addons access tokens).
    You have to ask for another one.


    * 403 - Forbidden. The token has no rights to the endpoint called. The
    endpoints must be allowed for an addon
      and the eshop must have approved them. Valid for addons access tokens, private tokens can always access all
      endpoints. Can be also returned when required module for request is missing.

    * 404 - Either the endpoint is wrong; or most commonly, an entity
    identifier, which is part of the URL, does
      not exist.

    * 409 - Conflict - the action could not be completed for some consistency
    rules, such as duplicate data
      or relation, which would be broken.

    * 413 - Payload too large - update requests can sometimes contain multiple
    entities to be amended. There is
      however a limit (varying for each request), how many can be specified within one request. If you breach the
      limit, you will get this error and nothing will be updated.

    * 422 - Unprocessable entity - we were not able to parse the request - it
    does not match the expected format.
      Something is wrong with the request as whole, it might not be a correct JSON or it does not match the expected
      JSON schema. There is no reason to retry, it will always fail.

    * 423 - Locked - for update and some read request we apply locks, usually on
    an URL level, which should avoid
      consistency problems possibly occuring from parallel updates. See [chapter about locks](#locks). Retry later,
      try to avoid parallel update requests.

    * 500 - General server error. Yes, this might happen to our software, too.
    Most commonly this is a temporary
      database issue and it might (but might not), work a few minutes later. We monitor all such errors and we
      try to analyze and fix them.

    * 503 - System maintenance. Most commonly we move a database to another
    database cluster or a database migration is
      pending and it will be available in a few minutes. Please try later.

    <a name="paginator"></a>


    ## Paging


    Some endpoints can return larger quantity of records. Such endpoints do not
    return the entire result, but support pagination of results.

    You can page using `page` (int) and `itemsPerPage` (int) parameters. The
    first page has number 1. If you require a different

    quantity of items per page, use the `itemsPerPage` parameter. CAUTION: the
    number of items per page can be decreased only, the default

    value is maximum. The default value can be different for each endpoint.


    When paging, check the total number of items, if not altered (`totalCount`),
    then the

    items on pages could be shifted and some of them could be missed or
    processed twice.


    <a name="include"></a>


    ## Section on demand


    Some endpoints return the data sections as optional, on demand. The request
    is done by giving the section name in the

    `include` parameter. Part of the data is returned each time, the other
    section only on demand. This makes the responses smaller for those, who do
    not need the data

    , thus saving the volume of data transmitted and shortening the time to
    process the request.


    For example, for "Eshop Info" endpoint, you will gain basic info when simply
    calling `[GET] /api/eshop`, but payment

    methods and transport options only when using `[GET]
    /api/eshop?include=paymentMethods,shippingMethods`.


    More values are separated by a comma, no sequencing, no upper/lower case
    differentiation. Other blocks are available on demand

    and each endpoint informs you which identifier to request.


    ## Testing against mock server


    If you want to receive a specific (error) response from the apiary mock
    server,

    you can force this using the `Prefer` header. For more information, see:

    https://help.apiary.io/tools/mock-server/#multiple-responses


    ## Translations


    For proper functionality in translations you will have to get module Foreign
    languages (Cizí jazyky) activated on customer e-shop. Multi-language support
    in API is handled by query parameter `language`, which can be used in whole
    API. If parameter is not set, default shop language is used.

    Read endpoints (HTTP verb GET) will return corresponding language version of
    texts where applicable.


    For write endpoints, first use POST endpoint to create entity and then use
    PATCH endpoint with corresponding language query parameter to set language
    fields.


    Please note that in some endpoints (typically surcharge/filtering/variant
    parameters) you must use the identifier's currently selected language
    variant (which is filtered in list).


    <a name="files"></a>


    ## Files


    For files upload, there are [Files endpoints](#files-endpoint).


    The file is uploaded to a temporary storage which is not accessible
    publicly. The file is kept there for 7 days and then deleted.


    After you upload a file, you may copy it to some API entities in their
    endpoints - you specify filename returned in response of upload job.


    Please note that currently only images (png, jpg, gif) are allowed filetypes
    for file upload.


    <a name="product-images"></a>


    # Product images


    Shoptet saves the product images in their original size and then prepares
    several sizes for standardized usage (called

    image cuts). These cuts are created in advance and saved on the disk, so
    they are readily available. The list of cuts is

    the same for each e-shop, and each e-shop can theoretically have different
    cut sizes. In practice, their size is given

    by the template and most templates use the same sizes. The list of provided
    cuts is given by

    the [Image cuts](#image-cuts) code list.


    The `/api/eshop?include=imageCuts` endpoint returns the `imageCuts` field in
    the response, where each cut has the actual

    size defined, and the URL base path. There are two base URLs (example for
    classic.shoptet.cz, cut `detail`):


    - `urlPath`: "https://classic.shoptet.cz/user/shop/detail/"


    - `cdnPath`:
    "https://cdn-api.myshoptet.com/usr/classic.shoptet.cz/user/shop/detail/"


    Use the `urlPath` in case you need an up-to-date image right now. Use the
    url for your backend processing and you

    will retrieve the images only once. Images retrieved via `urlPath` are not
    cached. You can use image name or SEO version

    of the image name - see below.


    Use the `cdnPath` in case you want to use the image url on the frontend and
    users of your application will display it,

    e.g. if you provide an alternative frontend, mobile application etc. The
    images are cached and provided with lower

    latency. Use `cdnName` retrieved from the product detail endpoint (or
    similar) - see below.


    Once you determine the URL based on the purpose and image cut size (for
    example `detail` for product detail, or `related`

    for product preview), just append the filename you need. The filename can be
    retrieved from Product detail endpoint.


    Although the e-shop is behind the content delivery network (Cloudflare CDN),
    API still returns the same domain. Whether

    the e-shop is behind the Cloudflare CDN, you can find out from response
    headers (`CDN-Loop: cloudflare` header).


    The product detail endpoint `/api/products/{guid}?include=images` returns
    the image field `data.images[]` in the same

    sequence, as these are entered in administration. The file name `name` (for
    example `100.jpg`) needs to be connected

    to the URL cut and then you have complete path to the image of a given cut
    (size), for example

    `https://classic.shoptet.cz/user/shop/detail/100.jpg`. You can also use
    `seoName`, which also contains a description

    of the image - you will be redirected to the same image. The `cdnName` is
    intended for use with the `cdnUrl` only.

    The fields look like: (excerpt)


    ```json
        "name": "106.png",
        "description": "shamrock 2115611 640",
        "seoName": "106_shamrock-2115611-640.png",
        "cdnName": "106_shamrock-2115611-640.png?5b2a41f5"
    ```


    One of the images mentioned for the product can be selected as the default
    image for the product variant. The selected

    image is in `data.variants[].image` item and contains the name of the image
    – this can be searched for in the image

    list, in the `name` item. Should the variant have no preselected default
    image, the parameter `image` is `null`.


    The item `data.items[].mainImage` contains the main image in order detail -
    this is either a default variant image,

    or, if not set (or product does not have variants), the default product
    image is given. The structure is the same as

    in product details, but not all images are given here, only the default one
    – representative image. The full path can

    be gained by assembling the `urlPath` from the e-shop info and the `name` or
    `seoName` items, given for the order item.


    Similarly, the product list gives `data.products[].mainImage`, which
    mentions the initial image for each product.

    ### Mass Webhooks


    These webhooks are sent when a mass change of entities is performed. The
    payload contains a json serialized list of IDs of changed entities.

    Purpose of these webhooks is to downgrade number of requests, while i.e.
    administrator performs mass change of orders status at once etc.

    So instead of emitting one event for every order, we emit one event for all
    of them.


    <strong>For now, if some mass event is performed, we also sent "single"
    webhook event for every updated entity as usual, but it will be changed in
    future,

    so please watch [release
    changes](https://developers.shoptet.com/category/api/) for more info
    </strong>

                      <p>As it is often the case with jackets for kids, the
                      emphasis is primarily on durability and quality
                      workmanship. It is clear that it will be put through its
                      paces, which the manufacturer has borne in mind. As
                      previously stated, the manufacturer could also afford a
                      less conservative design for a kids product, combining
                      bold colors with a company logo on the front and

        This endpoint allows you to insert products into Shoptet. You can use it
        for an import from an external system.

        Request is sent in JSON format in its body. For detailed description of
        items, which can be provided, see the right-most

        pane, section "Request" » "Attributes".


        **Currently it is possible to insert only a basic product attributes**


        When creating product without variants, add one variant to `variants`
        array and it will be created as product without variants,

        but with values specified in the `variant`.


        When creating product with multiple variants, you must specify
        `parameters` which are different in each variant (variant A with

        color black and size XXL and variant B with color yellow and size XXL is
        correct, but two variants with color black and size XXL is not correct).

        Also, `nameIndex` must be unique in a variant (variant A with color
        black and color white is not correct).

                    emphasis is primarily on durability and quality workmanship.
                    It is clear that it will be put through its paces, which the
                    manufacturer has borne in mind. As previously stated, the
                    manufacturer could also afford a less conservative design
                    for a kids product, combining bold colors with a company

                    It is clear that it will be put through its paces, which the
                    manufacturer has borne in mind. As previously stated, the
                    manufacturer could also afford a less conservative design
                    for a kids product, combining bold colors with a company

        Allows you to change a product, which is identified by the guid.


        This endpoint allows you to update products in Shoptet.

        Request is sent in JSON format in its body. For detailed description of
        items, which can be updated and their format,

        check the right-most pane, section "Request" » "Attributes"


        Product variant can be updated by specifying its `code`. When `code` is
        not specified or not existing, new variant will be created.

        If you want to change `code` of variant, use `code` to specify variant
        to be changed and `newCode` for specifying new code.


        Field `parameters` should contain ALL parameters that the edited variant
        should contain.

        That means, if you have for example "color:black" in variant and you
        specify only new parameter "size", parameter color will be deleted.

      summary: Product BATCH update
      operationId: Product BATCH update
      description: >-
        This endpoint allows you to update multiple products at once. Batch
        update is processed asynchronously in same way as for example products
        snapshot,

        but it does not have `resultUrl` with products to download in response.
        Instead, you can check attribute `log` which contains successfully
        updated products and errors.


        See how [Asynchronous
        requests](https://developers.shoptet.com/asynchronous-requests/) work on
        our developer's portal.


        File with data for update must be in JSONL
        ([jsonlines](https://jsonlines.org/)) format. Each line must contain one
        product in JSON format. Maximum size of file is 100MB.

        Structure of JSON row is same as structure of JSON for single product
        update above. You can add one extra optional attribute

        "language" which defines language of updating product, so you are able
        to update multiple language attributes (i.e. "name", "description" etc.)
        of one product in one batch file.

        If language is not defined, default language of shop is used.


        Asynchronous job process jsonl file row by row and try to validate and
        save data. If there is any error, row is skipped and error is logged,
        but it does not stop processing of other rows.

        In Log, every product is identified by its position in file (starting
        from 1).

                    It is clear that it will be put through its paces, which the
                    manufacturer has borne in mind. As previously stated, the

                    for a kids product, combining bold colors with a company

                    It is clear that it will be put through its paces, which the
                    manufacturer has borne in mind. As previously stated, the

                    for a kids product, combining bold colors with a company

      description: >-
        This endpoint allows you to update products identified by a product code
        in Shoptet.

        Request is sent in JSON format in its body. For detailed description of
        items, which can be updated and their format,

        check the right-most pane, section "Request" » "Attributes".


        Product variant can be updated by specifying its `code`. When `code` is
        not specified or not existing, new variant will be created.

        If you want to change `code` of variant, use `code` to specify variant
        to be changed and `newCode` for specifying new code.


        Field `parameters` should contain ALL parameters that the edited variant
        should contain.

        That means, if you have for example "color:black" in variant and you
        specify only new parameter "velikost", parameter color will be deleted.


        **Please note that any product's variant can be edited by this endpoint,
        not only the one in url**

        product variant, the entire product is deleted.

        If successful, returns the code 200.

        If the product variant does not exist within the e-shop, a 404 code is
        returned.

        If the product variant cannot be deleted, because it is part of set or
        used as a gift to some product, a 409 code is returned.

        Deletes product category as per entered `categoryGuid`. If successful,
        returns the code 200.

        If the category does not exist within the e-shop, a 404 code is
        returned.

        If the category cannot be deleted, because it is used by some product or
        has children, a 409 code is returned.

        Optional parameter `deleteUsed` allows deleting categories used by
        products. The products are marked as changed.

        Optional parameter `deleteChildren` allows deleting categories with
        child categories. The children are deleted too.

      summary: Update price list
      operationId: Update price list
      description: >-
        This endpoint allows updating price fields and other attributes from a
        pricelist of a product (variant).

        You can request multiple updates at once; the maximum is 100 updates per
        request.

        The request must contain a product variant code `code` and at least one
        of the `price`,
         `priceWithVat`, `priceWithoutVat`, `orderableAmount` or `sales` objects.

        Send only fields you want to change, the others will stay untouched. Be
        aware of the difference between


        - not providing a field: the field will not be changed


        - providing e. g. `data.price.buyPrice: null` will remove the price


        In case the request will be properly formatted, but an error occurs for
        one of the records, the correct records

        will be updated, the response will be `200 OK` and there will be records
        in the `errors` array for each failed

        record. If all records are incorrect, the response code will be `400 BAD
        REQUEST` instead.


        If you set `includingVat` or `vatRate` field, current data for product
        (or variant) will be recalculated. (even through untouched by your
        request)

        Object `price` directly sets price of product, without recalculating.

        Object `priceWithVat` sets price of product, respecting it is price
        **with** VAT and thus recalculating if needed.

        Object `priceWithoutVat` sets price of product, respecting it is price
        **without** VAT and thus recalculating if needed.


        Note, that you can change `buyPrice` only for default price list! For
        others price lists, value stays `null`.


        For non-vat payer e-shops, `vatRate` and `includingVat` fields are
        forbidden to use and fields `price`, `priceWithVat` and
        `priceWithoutVat`

        all works the same.

        List of orders in e-shop and cash desks. Endpoint supports
        [pagination](#paginator). For default calls, it returns 20 orders,

        using the parameter `?itemsPerPage=100`, you can request up to 100
        orders at a time. Temporarily disabled, only 20 orders per page is
        supported. We apologize for the inconvenience.


        The list can be filtered according to status, transport, payment, date
        of creation, order number and customer number.


        The code (`code`) is the order identifier. Although this is usually a
        number, it is necessary to take into account that this might also
        include

        letters, dash, etc.

        This endpoint enables insert the order into Shoptet, which was created
        in other system. You can use it for an import

        from an older e-shop solution, or to transfer orders from external sales
        channels.

        A large amount of info can be set, but for regular usage only a few
        attributes are needed. Values of other

        attributes are added as per their default values. The detailed
        information can be found in the right pane, after

        clicking on title "Order insertion" above (search for "Request" and
        "Attributes” sections).


        Request is sent in JSON format in its body. Simple example (detailed
        example can be found in call example in right pane):

        }

        ```


        Whether the field is mandatory, apart from the basic definition, also
        depends on whether the order was created via the cash desk

        (`cashDeskOrder: true`) or via e-shop. Some fields from invoicing,
        delivery and contact data

        are mandatory or optional, as per e-shop settings (see also e-shop
        administration `Settings > Customers > Mandatory fields`).


        When the order is created, it is checked, whether the e-shop includes
        products with the respective code (can be suppressed with

        GET parameter `suppressProductChecking=true`),

        the products from the order are deducted from the stock (can be
        suppressed with the GET parameter `suppressStockMovements=true`),
         documentation is created for the order (can be suppressed with the GET parameter `suppressDocumentGeneration=true`),
        a confirmation e-mail is sent (can be suppressed with the GET parameter
        `suppressEmailSending=true`) and a webhook is executed for the new
        order.

        If you are importing the history order or the order, which is handled by
        another EET system, the radio button `suppressEet=true` may be handy.


        **Parameters `suppressProductChecking=true` and
        `suppressStockMovements=true` are to be used only for orders that will
        not be changed or deleted in the future.

        Editing or deleting such an order can damage the consistency of
        warehousing.**


        Parameter `suppressHistoricalMandatoryFields=true` can be used to
        disable mandatory fields checks, but only for "historical"

        orders (`creationTime` is older than 24 hours). Keep in mind even
        historical orders should be kept consistent and complete

        as much as possible to allow their processing for statistics, volume
        calculations etc.


        Setting the mandatory items for invoicing and the delivery address can
        be different between individual e-shops. The mandatory items corresponds
        to the settings

        for ordering from the basket.


        Parameters `suppressHistoricalPaymentChecking` and
        `suppressHistoricalShippingChecking` allow corresponding field
        (`paymentMethodGuid` and/or `shippingGuid`)

        to be `null`. In that case, if an billing/shipping item is provided in
        `items` list, `name` field must be filled in that item.


        To remove products from the stock, the shop (or product) setting as to
        whether the inventory can be negative or not is respected.

        If a negative value is not permitted for shopping and the order cannot
        be covered from the current inventory, the order is not created and the
        API

        returns an error message in the `errors` field.


        The order's minimum size or maximum number of items as per the settings
        of e-shop are not checked.


        The endpoint only checks the same parameters as the order detail.


        The order can be inserted while using currencies setup in the eshop (see
        `/api/eshop`). The exchange rate related to the

        eshop default currency is optional. If not provided, the current eshop
        exchange rate will be used.

        For historical orders the exchange rate should be provided using the
        historical value of the order's creation date.

        Shoptet eshops do not store historical exchange rates.

        Warning: for SK and CZ different exchange rate format is used. You
        should use the same form as you get from the endpoint

        `/api/eshop`. We will internally convert it to the correct format to be
        compatible with eshop statistics calculations.

        Because of the conversion, the value of `exchangeRate` in the response
        will be different (inverse) to the one you had sent.


        When entering the order, the initial welcome e-mail is always sent. Even
        though the order status is set differently to the initial value,

        the e-mail associated with a status change is not sent, but the system
        welcome e-mail is (to e-shop operator and customer).


        When creating the receipt (invoice, proforma invoice, delivery note) the
        receipt is created with the current date and the 14 days due date, even
        though

        `creationTime` is given from the past.


        Examples of how to work with the order and items statuses, and how to

        This endpoint has several sections, which are only sent when requested
        in the `include` parameter (see

        [Requested sections](#include)).


        Value | Section

        --------|------

        `notes` | Order remarks, including up to six additional fields, which
        can be freely used by e-shop for its individual needs. The field names
        can be defined in administration and this section returns their names.

        `images`| Order images

        `shippingDetails`| Transport details

        `stockLocation`| Position in the stock

        `surchargeParameters`| Item surcharge parameters


        Returns the detail for one order. In the `items` field, the individual
        items of the order, including transport and payment methods.

        The product name and variants, weight, manufacturer and similar items
        are copied into the order items when the order is made.
         Even though the products are changed later in the shop, the orders are not affected. `productGuid` item contains
        GUID of purchased product. If this is changed or deleted, the order is
        not affected. You have to take into account that

        `productGuid` does not have to refer to an existing product. The same
        goes for the `code` item, containing the identification of a purchased

        variant or product. You have to take into account that when deleting the
        product or changing the `code` of the product, the reference from the
        order

        is lost. In other words, you have to take into account the fact that the
        `code` or `productGuid` do not have to refer to one of the currently
        existing

        products (variant). They may also be `null`.


        In most cases the items in the response are the same as you can see in
        the administration of PDF printout of an order.

        There are however some advanced cases (in case of coupon discount with
        absolute value or in case of

        a volume discount and products with multiple VAT rates in the order), in
        which case they are different:


        - Administration and PDF will show multiple rows for the discount – for
        each VAT rate one row and the price field split evenly.


        - The API response will return only one row indicating the total price
        of the discount.


        The difference is based on how data is internally stored and presented.
        The API is bases more on internal storage principle,

        there is however also an array `displayPrices`, which contains the
        presentation (printout) version of each item.


        If you state the `include=images` parameter within the URL, the
        information about the main image for all products in the order
         will also be part of the response. For more information about access to images go to [Product images](#product-images).

        In the `shippingDetails` section, there is an information about shipping
        the order. `branchId` is used for the identification of the carrier's
        branch and

        next fields are used for the detail of the branch (name, address, etc.).
        `carrierId` is used for the numeral identification of the carrier.
        Nowadays this field

        is used for Zasilkovna only and the value can be `null` for Czech
        Zasilkovna or integer for Zasilkovna in the other countries.

        This endpoint purpose is to add surcharge parameter in relation within
        order item.

        You have to send one of attributes `parameterCode` with `valueIndex` or
        `name`. Cant send this attributes together.

        If you post `parameterCode` and `valueIndex`, there will be validation,
        if surcharge parameter exits and if can be related

        to order item`s product and price (if not send) will be added from
        surcharge parameter itself.


        Otherwise you can send attribute `name` instead, which could have any
        form, but has to be unique. If price is not send,

        than it will be set to `0.00`.

        The endpoint shows the order history which is displayed in Shoptet
        administration in the

        “History” tab, in the order detail. Thus they are the most important
        system actions that have affected the order (they cannot be

        changed by the user) and then the notes added by the e-shop, primarily
        intended as messages between several employees,

        which may be needed to coordinate the order processing (these can be
        entered and deleted by the user).

        This endpoint may be used to add the user remark into the order history.

        For example the payment gateway may give the payment identification at
        its side, or

        add the remarks during the process of payment or order processing. The
        remarks

        are displayed in administration, in the “History” tab, in the order
        detail,

        together with main system changes of the order.

        The endpoint enables the remarks and additional fields (index 1 - 6) to
        be updated for the order. Within a call, the update

        of more data can be called for.


        The individual data object keys are not optional. Only the key values,
        which are included in the data object, will be updated.


        If "customerRemark", "trackingNumber", "eshopRemark" have a value of
        NULL, the originally saved value will be deleted.


        For additional fields ("additionalFields” key) only the fields included
        in this field are updated.


        If the key value is "text" for NULL additional field, the originally
        saved text in this field will be deleted.


        If the non-existing key is entered, or the call is erroneous in another
        way, no item is updated.


        **Please note that `trackingNumber` cannot be longer than 32
        characters.**

        **Please note that `additionalField` with index 1, 2 & 3 cannot be
        longer than 255 characters.**

      operationId: Update of order status
      description: >-
        The endpoint enables the order status, “paid” flag and payment method to
        be updated. This data must be set during a call.

        All the fields to be updated are optional, but at least one has to be
        specified.


        If the key value is "text" for NULL additional field, the originally
        saved text in this field will be deleted.


        If a non-existing key is entered, or the call is erroneous in another
        way, no item is updated.


        If you call the status setting within your request, which has "set the
        order as paid" in the definition, and at the same time you required

        a change of `paid` to `false`, the order status will be carried out and
        the `paid` value set to `false`.


        If the status definition includes sending an e-mail, such an e-mail will
        be sent. If not required, sending an e-mail can be suppressed with the

        `?suppressEmailSending=true` parameter. Similarly, sending information
        SMS messages when the order is changed (if set) can be suppressed
         with the `?suppressSmsSending=true` parameter. In analogy, if the status includes document generation (for example a proforma invoice),
        the document will be generated (if not existent). The generation can be
        suppressed with the `?suppressDocumentGeneration=true` parameter.


        This endpoint tries not to unnecessarily change the order status. If you
        try to set the status that the order already has, no change is done and
        no document is generated.

        When calling the same requests in parallel, there is the risk that there
        may be concurrence and related actions may be executed twice. Therefore
        we recommend calling this request from one source only, in a serial
        manner.


        Order status change might imply automatic documents (e. g. invoice)
        generation. In exceptional cases the generation might fail,

        although the order status itself gets actually changed. In such case the
        API return status code 200 (OK), but in the `data` field

        you can find the order details and in the `errors` array eventually
        details about the failed documents generation. The error

        code is `document-not-generated`. Example of an error message:


        ```

        "errors": [
            {
                "errorCode": "document-not-generated",
                "message": "Delivery note belonging to order \"2020000149\" was not created. Generating document code failed.",
                "instance": "2020000149"
            }
        ]

        ```

      summary: Update quantity in stock

      description: >-
        Endpoint enables the quantity of product in stock (relative and
        absolute) to be changed. Within a call, the update

        of multiple products at once can be requested (max. 50
        products/variants).


        In case an error occurs for one of the records, the correct records will
        be updated, the response will be `200 OK`

        and there will be records in the `errors` array for each failed record.
        If all records are incorrect, the response

        code will be `400 BAD REQUEST` instead.


        Item `productCode` is mandatory. Then one of the three items has to be
        provided:


        - `amountChange` to increase or decrease amount available for
        ordering/physically on stock (relative change)


        - `quantity` to set amount available for ordering (absolute amount)


        - `realStock` to set amount physically stored in a warehouse (absolute
        amount)


        The difference between `quantity` and `realStock` is amount of goods
        requested by the pending orders (so called "claim").


        `amount for ordering` = `realStock` - `claim`


        The claim cannot be changed explicitly, it is updated when a new order
        is submitted or an order is sent out. Please note,

        that the stock amount cannot be changed for product sets, where the
        amount is calculated dynamically from the individual

        products in the set. Trying to change the amount of product set will
        result in an error.

            suppress checking if new customer has filled all mandatory fields
            from eshop settings `Settings -> Customers -> Mandatory fields`.
            Suppressing this check can cause worse customer experience in order
            process for customers without all mandatory fields! However this can
            be useful for migration customers from older system without all
            necessary fields.

      summary: Registration of new webhook
      operationId: Registration of new webhook
      description: >-
        Registers the webhook. For a single event (`event`, for example
        `order:create`) **ONLY ONE** URL can be registered.

        If you try to enter the webhook for an `event` that already exists, you
        will
         receive error `422` with message `Webhook already exists for this event`. Successful creation (registration) of webhook is signaled by code `201`. The endpoint returns the info
        on the created webhook. One of the items is `id`, which is assigned to
        the webhook and is used for its identification

        upon change or deletion.


        The supported event can be found in code list <a
        href="#webhook-event-type">Webhook event types</a>.


        It is possible to enter up to 50 webhooks using a single call.

        **Please note that `url` cannot be longer than 2000 characters.**

      operationId: Adding a shipping method
      description: >-
        Adds a new shipping method for the specific e-shop.

        Should you wish to implement an addon implementing a shipping method,
        contact our partner support and request the creation

        of a new "shipping company code" identifier.


        The request body includes the mandatory attributes `name` and
        `shippingMethodCode` (or deprecated `shippingCompanyCode`). The other
        parameters are not

        mandatory and their default values will be used:


        - `description` - `null`


        - `visibility` - `false`


        - `wholesale` - `false`


        - `logo` - `null`


        - `minimalShippingPrice` - `0.00`


        Send the logo of the shipping method as the file content, encoded with
        base64, in `data.logo.content` request item.


        **Please note that `name` cannot be longer than 255 characters.**

        This endpoint allows you to add new e-mail addresses to the distribution
        list identified by its `code`. In the response you will receive
        structured info about the result of the insertion. In the
        `emailsInserted`

        key there will be a list of e-mails successfully inserted, in the
        `emailsExisting` key, there will be a list of skipped e-mails, because
        there were already in the list. In the

        `emailsInvalid` key, there will be a list of invalid e-mails (wrong
        format or non-existing MX domain record) and finally in the
        `errorMessages` key, there will be a list of error messages

        generated for invalid e-mails.

        This endpoint allows you to insert specific discount coupons into
        Shoptet. Request is sent in JSON format in its body.


        It is good to compare count of requested coupons with count of cooupons
        in response as it can be different. It is because of request validation,
        where it ignores invalid coupons.

        Performes file upload asynchronously.

        Please note that order of files matter (result of job respects the order
        of images in request).


        In case of specifying filename, keep in mind that extension is checked
        whether it respects file type.


        The result can be found in job detail in `resultUrl`. The result is
        formed as normal API response:


        ```

        {
            "data": {
                "images":[
                    {
                        "index": 0,
                        "md5": "072c1a2005e17dcd3a3cca3d2c769264",
                        "name": "kocka.png",
                        "created": "2023-01-16T13:19:32+0100",
                        "sourceUrl": "https://example.com/image.png"
                    }
                ]
            },
            "errors": [
                {
                    "errorCode": "file-upload-extension-mismatch",
                    "message": "File extension png mismatch mime type image\/jpeg of uploaded file (correct should be jpg).",
                    "instance": "data[1]"
                }
            ]
        }

        ```


        In the result's `images` section, there are successfully uploaded images
        with their info and with `index` field which is order of the image in
        the request (0-based indexing).


        In the result's `errors` section, there are errors which occured during
        some images upload and with number in brackets in `data[0]` in
        `instance`, which is order of the image in the request (0-based
        indexing).


        See more about file upload in the [files section of
        documentation](#files)


        See how [Asynchronous
        requests](https://developers.shoptet.com/asynchronous-requests/) work on
        our developer's portal.


        Currently maximum of 50 files can be uploaded in one request. Current
        filesize limit per file is 2MB.

      The code (`code`) is the proforma invoice identifier. Although this is
      usually a number, it is necessary to take into account that this might
      also include

      letters, a dash, etc.

      In the last Shoptet version, it is not possible to change the e-shop
      design via API. However, it is possible to include HTML codes

      into previously defined places. This enables the code or link to a file
      containing additional CSS styles or JavaScript codes to be entered.

      The same functionality is now included within the e-shop administration
      (`/admin/html-kody/`, `HTML code` tab).


      There are 3 possible locations, where HTML codes can be inserted:


      * `common-header` - the code will be inserted into each e-shop page header
      (`<HEAD>`)


      * `common-footer` - the code will be inserted into each e-shop page foot
      (before end `</BODY>`)


      * `order-confirmed` - the code will be inserted in the page confirming the
      order (the "thank you page")


      The inserted codes may come from 3 sources, and they are included in the
      following order:

      1. Codes from addons (the addon defines HTML codes to be inserted for
      anybody, who installs the addon). If there are more of these, they are
      inserted progressively, the order cannot be relied upon.

      2. Codes entered via API. Each addon can insert only one code into each
      location. If there are more of these addons, the codes will be inserted
      progressively, one after another, the order cannot be relied upon.

      3. The code entered in the administration GUI (`/admin/html-kody/`, `HTML
      code` tab)

      API endpoints for integration of payment gateways.


      **If you are a Premium client, contact your Account or Onboarding manager.
      New payment gateway has to be approved by Shoptet and client needs to be
      familiar with the terms of payment in advance.**

      API endpoints for webhook servicing. It offers the possibility to read,
      add, change and delete the registered webhooks. Furthermore, it offers

      a list of notifications about invoked webhooks and their status.


      The webhooks are HTTP calls, which send HTTPs calls to registered
      subscribers if a specific event happens,

      for example creating an order. Then the information, in JSON format, is
      delivered to the defined URL.


      ```javascript

      {
          "eshopId": 222651,
          "event": "order:create",
          "eventCreated": "2019-01-08T15:13:39+0100",
          "eventInstance": "2018000057"
      }

      ```


      The meaning of individual items:


      * `eshopId` - number of the e-shop, where the event happened


      * `event` - event which invoked the call (see code list <a
      href="#webhook-event-type">Webhook event types</a>)


      * `eventCreated` - accurate time, when the event happened


      * `eventInstance` - reference to a specified entity - according to the
      context, order number, invoice number, product GUID, etc.

      This functionality allows you to manage a list of email addresses that
      opted out of receiving marketing communications in compliance with legal
      requirements, including the possibility of comparing any further mailings
      with this list to exclude opt-out contacts.

      The functionality is subject to module activation [Mass
      e-mailing](https://doplnky.shoptet.cz/hromadne-rozesilani-emailu) within
      the e-shop. The addon using this endpoint must therefore have this module
      defined as dependency.
